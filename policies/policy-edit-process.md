Technical Policy Edit Process
=============================

This policy represents the way that corrective changes to policies, that don't
change the meaning of those policies, are proposed, edited, and approved.

For substantial policy additions, changes and removals, please see the [Policy
on Proposing Technical Policy Changes]

Policy Edit Proposal
--------------------

The policy edits are submitted as pull requests in the technical-policies
repository on GitHub OpenSSL project. Anyone with a GitHub account can submit
a policy edit proposal pull request.

Any policy edit proposal SHOULD have a single topic.

The description of the pull request SHOULD provide an overview of the edits
and the reasons why the edit is proposed.

Review and Approval
-------------------

Policy edit submissions must be reviewed and approved by at least two
committers, one of whom must also be an OTC member.  Neither of the reviewers
can be the author of the submission.

Approved submissions shall only be applied after a 24-hour delay from the
approval.

If the policy edit is approved, the pull request is merged to the master
branch of the technical-policies repository.
