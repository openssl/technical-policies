# OpenSSL Technical Policies

This repository contains the technical policies and procedures established by
the [OTC] in accordance with the [project bylaws] and the requirements specified
by the [OMC].


## The Policies

The policies are stored in the [policies] subdirectory, each in
a separate markdown file called `policy-name.md` where `policy-name` is a short
memorable description of the policy such as `voting-procedure`, `design-process`,
or similar.

New policies or changes to existing policies are proposed and discussed in pull
requests and issues of this repository, and finally merged after an approval by
an OTC vote. The details are regulated by the [policy-change-process] and the
[voting-procedure] policy.


## The Vote Records

The records of the policy votes are stored in the [votes] subdirectory,
each in a separate file. The format of those records is described in the
[voting-procedure] policy.
